  summary: Create a seek
  description: "\n
  \ Create a public seek, to start a game with a random player.\n\n
  \ ### Real-time seek\n\n
  \ Specify the `time` and `increment` clock values.
  \ The response is streamed but doesn't contain any information.\n\n
  \ **Keep the connection open to keep the seek active**.\n\n
  \ If the client closes the connection, the seek is canceled. This way, if the client terminates, the user won't be paired in a game they wouldn't play.\n
  \ When the seek is accepted, or expires, the server closes the connection.\n\n
  \ **Make sure to also have an [Event stream](#operation/apiStreamEvent) open**, to be notified when a game starts.\n
  \ We recommend opening the [Event stream](#operation/apiStreamEvent) first, then the seek stream. This way,\n
  \ you won't miss the game event if the seek is accepted immediately.\n\n
  \ ### Correspondence seek\n\n
  \ Specify the `days` per turn value.
  \ The response is not streamed, it immediately completes with the seek ID. The seek remains active on the server until it is joined by someone."
