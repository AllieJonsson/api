  summary: Stream an ongoing broadcast tournament as PGN
  description: |
    This streaming endpoint first sends all games of a broadcast tournament in PGN format.
    Then, it waits for new moves to be played. As soon as it happens, the entire PGN of the game is sent to the stream.
    The stream will also send PGNs when games are added to the tournament.
    This is the best way to get updates about an ongoing tournament. Streaming means no polling,
    and no pollings means no latency, and minimum impact on the server.
