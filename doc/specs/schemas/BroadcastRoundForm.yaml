      Filter games by round number

      Optional, only keep games from the source that match a round number.
      It uses the PGN **Round** tag. These would match round 3:
      ```txt
      [Round "3"]
      [Round "3.1"]
      ```
      If you set a round number, then games without a **Round** tag are dropped.

      It only works if you chose `syncUrl` or `syncUrls` as the source.
  slices:
    type: string
    description: |
      Select slices of the games

      Optional. Select games based on their position in the source.
      ```txt
      1           only select the first board
      1-4         only select the first 4 boards
      1,2,3,4     same as above, first 4 boards
      11-15,21-25 boards 11 to 15, and boards 21 to 25
      2,3,7-9     boards 2, 3, 7, 8, and 9
      ```
      Slicing is done after filtering by round number.

      It only works if you chose `syncUrl` or `syncUrls` as the source.
